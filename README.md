# Vortex patch and sheet equilibria

Supplementary material to [1]. Included is the code for computing
-  Vortex patch equilibria
-  Point vortex-vortex patch equilibria
-  Vortex sheet equilibria
-  Coating problem

The chebfun package is required to run these codes, this can be downloaded from https://www.chebfun.org/.
